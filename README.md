# Sleep-Stage-Classification
This repository is created by Mingkai Xu(xumk17@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) for our AI medical product which used for classifying sleep stage and sleep events by eeg signals.

Since it is a classified project, this repository is now opened to professor Wang's students only, though the experimental code is available, it should not be used by others.

This project is highly unaccomplished, uploading to github is mainly for convenience. If you are interested in this project, it is welcomed to contact us. By the day this project is completed, the code and data may be sorted out and there will be clearer documentation.
